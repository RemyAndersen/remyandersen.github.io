	I am a lover of Shakespearean literature. My favorite play is As You Like It. The first Shakespearean play I ever saw was Much Ado About Nothing.
	The production company had reimagined it as an event set right after the Civil War. The feud between the brothers was escalated by the fact that they
	were on different sides of the war. One of my favorite activeties is just reading different Shakespearean books whilst enjoying nature. I also love 
	reading poetry. My favorite poet is Walt Whitman. I love the way he writes about America in such a beautiful and sincere manner. I also enjoy drinking tea. 
	One of my favorite things is playing guitar and teaching myself new songs. I've been playing since I was a kid. I have a weird love of history and learning.
	Museums are my favorite places in the world. When I was a kid I wanted to be that person that knew every fact. In some ways I still aspire to be that person.
	I always want to learn more because I feel like there is always so much to know. I care a great deal about social issues. I don't understand the point of
	a society that doesn't care about it's citizens. I spend a lot of time campaining for and championing issues I think matter and need attention.
