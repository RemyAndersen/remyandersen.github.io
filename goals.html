		My goals are very personal to me. I care very deeply for people and I hope to impact the community in a positive way. One of my passions is the trans
		community. I have had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful trans people, one of which is homeless. The trans community is more suceptable to youth 
		homelessness than most communities and about 60% of kids on the streets are trans. I want to do something to help this. My goal is to create a 
		group of shelters, both for trans youth and also kids that need a safe space to go. I have been blessed in the sense that I typically had safe spaces
		availiable to me and I want to give that to others. In a business sense I want to help create sustainable businesses. I would like to explore ways to 
		create environmentaly friendly business practices.
