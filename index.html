		Hi my name is Remus. I come from a little town called Papillion, Nebraska. Most people that I meet don't know anything about Nebraska.
		I go to the University of Maine. I hope to graduate with a degree in Business Management. In these few pages of my website I will explore my early life 
		in Nebraska, the differences between Nebraska and Maine, my interests, and goals. 
		</p>
		
		First a couple of things about me:
		<ul>
		<li> I once owned a pet cow. </li>
		<li> I love pineapple pizza. </li>
		<li> I was a champion muttenbuster (sheep rider) as a kid. </li>
		<li> My favorite place is the Field Museum in Chicago. </li>
		<li> If I could go anywhere in the universe I would go to Keplar 32B. </li>
		</ul>
