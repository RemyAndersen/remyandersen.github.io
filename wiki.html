		I was born, as is the family tradition, in a small hospital in Fremont, Nebraska. I was declared a girl must to my family's joy. 
		Much of my early life was spent growing up in North Omaha. I climbed trees, and liked to play with my friends and randomly run away to the park, 
		which terrified my mother. When I was seven, my parents made the decision to move us to Sarpy County to make room for my newborn sister. 
		I lived most of my life in a blue house with red brick and a white porch. It was very patriotic looking, which really fit with my dad's aestetic. 
		My dad is a very hardworking man and wasn't home a lot when I was growing up. He owned his own business and was out helping client's at all times
		of the night. My mother stayed at home to raise us. My older sister, Danielle, and I were very close as kids.

		We spent a lot of time at my grandparent's farm in Hermon, Nebraska as kids. Often we spent the night at my Aunt Julie's farm. She would make us 
		homemade donuts when we woke up. In a lot of ways, they raised me more than my parents did. I grew up collecting eggs, feeding cows and wild cats, 
		and riding horses. I went to a Christian elementary school, which I hated, before going to public school for Junior High and High School. And now 
		here I am at the University of Maine. I left Nebraska because at the end of the day I believe in exploration. My plan was always to leave. I think 
		college is a time to step away from comfort and explore the world, specifically the parts that dazzle or impress you. I'm happy to make Maine my home.
