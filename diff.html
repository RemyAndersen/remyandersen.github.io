		When I tell people I'm from Nebraska, the reaction is usually that of shock. Most people can't believe I would come all the way to Maine for school. 
		It's quite the differnce. For instance, Nebraska is all flat. Maine has mountains, rivers, and forests. Nebraska is all fields; fields of corn, wheat,
		and soy beans. Maine is mostly forestry. It is full of a diverse amount of trees that are practically unrecognizable to me. The smog is also an 
		unexpected difference. I love the stars, but in Nebraska the smog is so bad I can barely see the Big Dipper on a clear night in the middle of nowhere. 
		This is because cow farts are a main pollutant of the environment and Nebraska is full of them. In Maine I can see not only the constellations in their
		entirety but also the stars around them. It's practically magic. The people here are also different. Everyone in Maine is very kind in a truely genuine
		way. In Nebraska there is a sense of hatred for differences and its very divisive. The differences are sometimes more mundane. For instance, Mainers are 
		all about hockey, Nebraskan culture is basically all Husker football. When the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers play the streets are baren and everyone
		stops working just to watch the game. The meat quality is also different. Nebraska is all about beef and corn, but Maine is all about seafood. I tried a 
		burger here and only got through one bite. When I went home for break I got a burger and cried because it was so good.
